## Part 1:ðŸ›’ JavaScript Shopping Cart Project
# The project involves creating a product array and printing it in the console, then dynamically displaying the product list in the DOM using .map(). Each product should have an "Add" button, and when clicked, the selected items are pushed into a cart array. The product quantity should be updated after each purchase to simulate inventory management, and the cart total must be calculated and displayed dynamically.
